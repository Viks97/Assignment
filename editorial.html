        Mr. Azad is free to interact with people, but cannot hold any political rallies during his visit to State.

        Mr. Azad had moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to visit his home State to enquire about the well being
        of his family members. He said he has filed the petition in his personal capacity and it is apolitical. His plea
        was taken up by a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S.A. Bobde and S. Abdul Nazeer.

    <p>
        <span style="color: red;font-size: 20pt"> Mr. Azad had tried to visit the State after the abrogation of Jammu
            and Kashmir’s special status </span><span style="font-size: 20">but was sent back from the airport by
            authorities.

            While the Congress had taken a strong position against the abrogation, Mr. Azad said the media should not
            analyse his petition pending before the top court.</span>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt">
        “I have filed the petition in my personal capacity, not on behalf of the Congress. It has nothing do with
        politics and is based purely on humanitarian grounds. I tried thrice to go to my home State but was refused
        permission. Almost one-third of Kashmiri people are lakhs who do labour to earn their daily livelihood and
        nobody is bothered to know how are they surviving,” he said. <br />

        “I have expressed concern about the plight of those people on humanitarian basis, being a native, and as a
        member of Parliament from Jammu and Kashmir. It has been 42 days...What are they eating, drinking and how are
        they surviving, this is a question to the State government, the central government and to the media as well,” he
        said. <br />

        In his petition before the top court, he has also sought permission to check on social conditions in the State
        after the clampdown imposed by the authorities in the aftermath of the revocation of provisions of Article 370.
        <br />

        Several opposition leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, had sought to visit Jammu and Kashmir, but
        were not allowed to do so and were sent back from the airport itself. <br />

        CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury had moved the apex court to see his ailing party colleague Mohammed Yousuf
        Tarigami, which allowed him to pay a visit but with certain conditions.<br />
